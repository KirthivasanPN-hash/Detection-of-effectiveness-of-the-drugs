Our idea is based on iOT which helps in detecting the effectiveness of the drug.
The logic can be implemented with the help of Raspberry pi and measures the temperature with the help of sensors by detecting  main symptoms such as dehydration, red eyes and also with help of speech recognition we understand his health condition even better,     
The reports are stored and retrieved with help of cloud.
 Doses are analysed by which the doctors can understand whether  the person can handle more such doses or not, 
this can be really helpful for fighting the  pandemic situation and by which doctors can research more the drug part and get the best results out of this.
